# Contributing
There are only a few ways to contribute the project currently:
1. Changing a description of a property/pseudo-class/etc. is done in the CSS custom data (`data/panorama.css-data.json`)
2. Changing syntax coloring is done in the tmLanguage (`syntaxes/panoramacss.tmLanguage.json`)
3. Chaning/Adding snippets is done in the various snippet JSON files (`snippets/*`). To add a new snippet, create a JSON file in that folder and make sure it is added in `package.json`.

Make sure your commits follow [convential commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)!

Feel free to add yourself as a contributor to `package.json` if you do want credit :)
