2. Changing syntax coloring is done in the tmLanguage (`syntaxes/panorama_css.tmLanguage.json` / `syntaxes/panorama_scss.tmLanguage.json`)
3. Chaning/Adding snippets is done in JSON files in `snippets/`. To add a new snippet, create a JSON file in that folder and make sure it is added in `package.json`.
