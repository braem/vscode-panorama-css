## [0.4.0] - 2022-02-14
### Changed
- Panorama CSS/SCSS are now their own languages, which allows for better completion and validation
- Lots of bloat removed so that only Panorama supported properties/selectors/etc. are present
- Now Link to VDC and MDN (where applicable)

### Fixed
- Properties in MDN and Panorama now show the appropriate Panorama-specific descriptions and a reference to VDC
